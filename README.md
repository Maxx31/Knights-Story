# Knights Story
This is my educational project, made in the style of a 2D platformer on android. Everything in the game except for the graphics (taken from the Asset Store) and the sound was done by myself.

## Game process:
The gameplay consists of three different levels consisting of enemy characters, traps and a boss at the end. Along the way, the player will unlock both active and passive skills that can be selected.
## Development: 
There are three patterns implemented in the game code (Singleton, Observer, State). In the process, a particle system for various effects is implemented, and a bit of a  shader graph.
